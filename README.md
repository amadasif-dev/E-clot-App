Welcome to your new React Native project! You have used `@react-native-community/cli` to bootstrap the project. To start Metro, navigate to the root of your React Native project and run the following command:

```
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

After starting Metro, open a new terminal from the root of your React Native project. To start your Android or iOS app, run the following command:

### For Android

```
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, your app should start running on your Android Emulator or iOS Simulator shortly. Alternatively, you can also run your app directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

Once you have successfully run the app, you can modify it. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor and edit some lines. To see your changes, press the `R` key twice for Android or hit `Cmd + R` in your iOS Simulator.

Congratulations! You have successfully run and modified your React Native app. If you want to learn more about integrating this new React Native code with an existing application or want to learn more about React Native in general, check out the [Integration guide](URL_1/docs/integration-with-existing-apps) and the [Introduction to React Native](URL_1/docs/getting-started) respectively.
